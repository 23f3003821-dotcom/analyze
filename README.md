# My Responsive Tailwind App

This repository contains a single-page, responsive web application built using HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS. It serves as a boilerplate or a demonstration for a modern front-end setup, focusing on a clean design and mobile-first responsiveness.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
-   **Single-File Application**: All HTML, CSS (via CDN), and minimal JavaScript are contained within `index.html` for easy deployment and sharing.
-   **Modern Styling**: Utilizes the power of Tailwind CSS to provide a clean, customizable, and component-friendly design system.
-   **Simple Navigation**: Basic navigation structure with a mobile-friendly toggle menu.
-   **Interactive Elements**: Includes simple JavaScript for UI interactions (e.g., mobile menu).

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Structure and content of the web page.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   **JavaScript**: Minimal scripting for interactive elements.

## Getting Started

To view this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No build steps or server are required for the front-end itself as Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN.
